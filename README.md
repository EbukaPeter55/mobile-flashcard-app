# mobile-flashcard-app
Final project for the React Nanodegree program. A React native project for that has been built and tested for the Android platform.

Mobile flash card is a gamelike quiz app, where users can take up questions previously created. Each of this question
has a button to view the answer, and two choices which are: Correct or Incorrect. Users are meant to select one option
and at the end of the quiz after attempting all questions, the percentage scored by a user is displayed.

The app has categories which are called Decks, so each of those decks, have cards or questions.

This React Native app was bootstrapped using the expo-cli
